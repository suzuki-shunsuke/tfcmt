Fork of [mercari/tfnotify](https://github.com/mercari/tfnotify)

tfcmt is a CLI tool to improve the experience of CI of Terraform.
By posting the result of `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` to GitHub Pull Requests as a comment,
you can know the result quickly without browsing the CI web page.

tfcmt enhances tfnotify in many ways, including Terraform >= v0.15 support and advanced formatting options.

You can separate the changes outside of Terraform.
